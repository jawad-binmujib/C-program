# Keywords and Identifiers in C Programming
    ## Keywords in C Programming
        In C programming, keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in the language. 
        These words cannot be used for variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. 
        Each keyword serves a specific purpose in the C language and is part of the language's syntax.

Here are some common keywords in C:

- int     : Used to declare integer variables.
- float   : Used to declare floating-point variables.
- char    : Used to declare character variables.
- if      : Used for conditional statements.
- else    : Used with `if` for alternative conditions.
- while   : Used for a loop that continues while a condition is true.
- for     : Used for a for-loop structure.
- return  : Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
- break   : Exits from a loop or switch statement.
- continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next one.
- switch  : Used for multi-way branching.
- case    : Defines possible branches in a `switch` statement.
- struct  : Defines a structure to store multiple data types.
- void    : Used for functions that do not return a value.
- static  : Defines a variable or function with local scope but persistent memory.

## The key point is that you cannot use them as names for variables, functions, or other identifiers in your code.
