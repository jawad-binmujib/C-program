int --> It means main() will return an integer value to the operating system when the program finishes executing.
main() --> This is the name of the function where the program starts executing.
() --> In this case, it takes no parameters (empty parentheses).
printf --> It's a function that used to display output on the screen
This printf statement outputs the text "Hello World" to the screen.
return 0; --> In C, it's used in the main function to indicate that the program has successfully executed.

int main(){
    printf("Hello World");

}
