Input/Output in C Programming
    - Input and Output (I/O) in C are essential for interacting with the user and external systems. 
    - This guide covers the basics to advanced I/O in C.

Introduction to I/O
    - C uses the stdio.h library for standard input and output operations.
    - Input : Accept data from the user (e.g., keyboard).
    - Output: Display data to the user (e.g., screen).

Common Functions
    - Input : scanf, getchar, fgets
    - Output: printf, putchar, puts

Output Functions
    - Using printf
        printf is used for formatted output.

    Format Specifier	    |   Description
    ------------------------|----------------------
    %d	                    |    Integer
    %f	                    |    Floating-point
    %c	                    |    Single character
    %s	                    |    String
    
    - Using putchar
        Outputs a single character to the screen.
    
    - Using puts
        Outputs a string and automatically appends a newline.


Input Functions
    - Using scanf
        Reads formatted input from the user.

    - Using getchar
        Reads a single character from the input.

    - Using fgets (Preferred over gets)
        Reads a string safely (avoids buffer overflow).

Escape Sequences
    - Escape sequences allow you to include special characters in strings.

Escape Sequence	   |     Meaning
-------------------|--------------------
\n	               |     Newline
\t	               |     Tab
\\	               |     Backslash
\"	               |     Double quote
